## **Experience**
Concise timeline of technical growth & contributions.

| Role | Scope | Period | Focus / Impact |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Software Engineering Student / Independent Builder | Personal & Academic Projects | 2020 – Present | Built 30+ learning & prototype repos across Java, Python, Web; continuous skill expansion. |
| Open Source Contributor | Forked OSS (Playwright, MkDocs, Extent Reports, SN snippets) | 2024 – Present | Exploring upstream ecosystems, adapting tooling, minor improvements & usage feedback. |
| Community Learner | freeCodeCamp / Hyperskill Tracks | 2022 – 2023 | Completed foundational Java, Web, Node/Express, npm package management coursework. |

### Selected Impact & Learning Notes
| Area | Example | Stack / Concept | Note |
|------|--------|-----------------|------|
| Product-style build | `GourmetHub` recipe + local LLM assistant | Java / Spring / AI Integration | Designing domain model & future ingestion pipeline. |
| Platform / backend design | `BookWise` library system | Java / Maven | Emphasis on modular structure & entity relationships. |
| Frontend SPA | `advisor` instant advice app | React / Fetch API | Lightweight UX + external public API consumption. |
| Portfolio presence | `razorblack.github.io` | HTML / CSS | Iterative personal branding & deployment. |
| CLI / fundamentals | Coffee Machine & Simple Chatty Bot | Java (CLI) | Strengthened control flow & I/O patterns early. |
| Language breadth | python_programming / C_Programming / PrologProgramming | Python / C / Prolog | Practiced paradigms: scripting, procedural, logic. |
| Learning repos | java_programming | Java | Ongoing catalog of algorithmic & practice problems. |

### Open Source & Community
- Forked and tracked upstream changes in Playwright, MkDocs, ExtentReports adapters to study project structure & contribution workflow.
- Participated in structured learning repos (DSA bookmarks, Node/Express, npm management) reinforcing backend foundations.
- Early exploration into ServiceNow ecosystem via `sn-code-snippets` fork for studying platform automation patterns.

### Core Technical Progression
1. Foundations (2020–2021): General programming (Python, C) and console Java mini‑projects to build syntax & problem solving.
2. Broadening (2022–2023): Web fundamentals (HTML/CSS, responsive design), Node & Express basics, npm workflows, front-end experimentation.
3. Depth (2024): Investigated mature OSS codebases (Playwright, MkDocs) to internalize scalable project layout & testing culture.
4. Product Orientation (2025): Transitioning to cohesive domain projects (GourmetHub, BookWise) emphasizing architecture, modularity, and future AI augmentation.

### Achievements & Milestones
- 35+ public repositories demonstrating consistent iterative practice.
- Cross-language exposure (Java, Python, C, Prolog, JavaScript) supporting adaptable problem framing.
- Built and deployed a personal portfolio site consolidating presence & branding.
- Maintained multi-year continuity in repository activity (no multi‑year gaps since 2020 entry into ecosystem).
- Progressive shift from small console exercises to multi-module service design (2025 projects).

### Next Focus (Forward-Looking)
- Formalize testing & CI (GitHub Actions) for new service repos.
- Introduce persistence & API layering (e.g., PostgreSQL + Spring Data in BookWise / GourmetHub).
- Add structured contribution PRs upstream instead of passive forks (documentation, small bug fixes).
- Explore containerization & deployment (Docker + minimal cloud target) for at least one backend project.
